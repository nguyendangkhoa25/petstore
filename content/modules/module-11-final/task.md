# Module 11: Final Assignment

## Task

The source code is available [here](../../../petstore).

Throughout the course, we gradually built the PetStore application step by step.
Now, for the final task, your goal is to bring all these individual pieces together into a single solution, following the diagram. Additionally, make sure to address the points mentioned below.

> **NOTE:** For the deployment of services in this task, you may choose to use either **Azure App Services or Azure Container Apps** (the diagrams will depict App Services).

**Please complete the following task:**

1. PetStore public API services should be available for auto-scaling.
2. *If using Azure App Services*: PetStore Web App should support deployment slots. *If using Azure Container Apps*:
   PetStore Web App should support multi-revision deployments.
3. Pet and Product Services should use Azure SQL as a database.
4. Order Service should use Cosmos DB as a database.
5. Order Items Reserver function should be able to create Reservation JSON files in Azure Blob Storage by communicating through Service Bus and handle errors by sending the email through Logic Apps.
6. PetStore Web App is protected by Microsoft Entra External ID for authentication.

**Definition of Done:**

1. The PetStore Public API services are configured for auto-scaling.
2. *If using Azure App Services*: Deployment slots are set up for the PetStore Web App. *If using Azure Container Apps*:
   Multi-revision deployments are configured for the PetStore Web App with traffic distribution.
3. The Pet and Product Services have successfully migrated to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
4. The Order Service has been updated to use Cosmos DB as its database.
5. The Order Items Reserver Azure Function is able to create Reservation JSON files in Azure Blob Storage by communicating through the Service Bus.
6. Error handling is implemented to send emails through Logic Apps when issues with creating Reservation JSON files are encountered.
7. The PetStore Web App is secured with Microsoft Entra External ID for authentication.
